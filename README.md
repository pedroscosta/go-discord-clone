# Discord Clone

This project is a basic Discord clone made using Go. This was made to solve a technical challenge created by [DanielHe4rt]([DanielHe4rt](https://github.com/DanielHe4rt)), available [here](https://gist.github.com/DanielHe4rt/4012e5bf9c612d9cee9efa654eb32f6d) (The challenge was written in Portuguese, but the requirements should be easy to translate).

## Demo
